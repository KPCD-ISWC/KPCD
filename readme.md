# Knowledge Path Constrained Decoding for Knowledge Mapping (KPCD)

Source code for "Knowledge Path Constrained Decoding for Knowledge Mapping".

## Overview

The KPCD model is implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/). It leverages large language models with constrained decoding techniques to achieve efficient and precise concept predictions.

## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use KPCD for training and inference.

```bash
python src/main.py
```
