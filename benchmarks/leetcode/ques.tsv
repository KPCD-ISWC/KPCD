Youmustwork every week.You cannot work on two milestones from the same project for two consecutive weeks.Once all the milestones of all the projects are finished, or if the only milestones that you can work on will cause you to violate the above rules, you will stop working. Note that you may not be able to finish every projects milestones due to these constraints.Return the maximum number of weeks you would be able to work on the projects without violating the rules mentioned above.

56	Minimum Total Space Wasted With K Resizing Operations You are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is the number of elements that will be in the array at time i. In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum number of times you can resize the array (to any size).The size of the array at time t, sizet, must be at least nums[t] because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The space wasted attime t is defined as sizet - nums[t], and the total space wasted is the sum of the space wasted across every time t where 0 = t  nums.length.Return the minimum total space wasted if you can resize the array at most k times.Note: The array can have any size at the start and does not count towards the number of resizing operations.
57	Check if Move is Legal You are given a 0-indexed 8 x 8 grid board, where board[r][c] represents the cell (r, c) on a game board. On the board, free cells are represented by ., white cells are represented by W, and black cells are represented by B.Each move in this game consists of choosing a free cell and changing it to the color you are playing as (either white or black). However, a move is only legal if, after changing it, the cell becomes the endpoint of a good line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).A good line is a line of three or more cells (including the endpoints) where the endpoints of the line are one color, and the remaining cells in the middle are the opposite color (no cells in the line are free). You can find examples for good lines in the figure below:Given two integers rMove and cMove and a character color representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return true if changing cell (rMove, cMove) to color color is a legal move, or false if it is not legal.
58	Delete Duplicate Folders in System Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.For example, [one, two, three] represents the path /one/two/three.Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.For example, folders /a and /b in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:/a/a/x/a/x/y/a/z/b/b/x/b/x/y/b/zHowever, if the file structure also included the path /b/w, then the folders /a and /b would not be identical. Note that /a/x and /b/x would still be considered identical even with the added folder.Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
59	Maximum Compatibility Score Sum There is a survey that consists of n questions where each questions answer is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).The survey was given to m students numbered from 0 to m - 1 and m mentors numbered from 0 to m - 1.

The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array mentors where mentors[j] is an integer array that contains the answers of the jth mentor (0-indexed).Each student will be assigned to one mentor, and each mentor will have one student assigned to them. The compatibility score of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.For example, if the students answers were [1, <u>0</u>, <u>1</u>] and the mentors answers were [0, <u>0</u>, <u>1</u>], then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to maximize the sum of the compatibility scores.Given students and mentors, return the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved.

To mutate a substring, replace each digit num[i] with the digit it maps to in change (i.e. replace num[i] with change[num[i]]).Return a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of num.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
61	Sum of Digits of String After Convert You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer k.First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace a with 1, b with 2, ..., z with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.For example, if s = zbax and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:Convert: zbax ➝ (26)(2)(1)(24) ➝ 262124 ➝ 262124Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4➝ 17Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.
62	Maximum Genetic Difference Query There is a rooted tree consisting of n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1. Each nodes number denotes its unique genetic value (i.e. the genetic value of node x is x). The genetic difference between two genetic values is defined as the bitwise-XOR of their values. You are given the integer array parents, where parents[i] is the parent for node i. If node x is the root of the tree, then parents[x] == -1.You are also given the array queries where queries[i] = [nodei, vali]. For each query i, find the maximum genetic difference between vali and pi, where pi is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between nodei and the root (including nodei and the root). More formally, you want to maximize vali XOR pi.Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Starting with 0 points, you want to maximize the number of points you can get from the matrix.To gain points, you must pick one cell in each row. Picking the cell at coordinates (r, c) will add points[r][c] to your score.However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows r and r + 1 (where 0 = r  m - 1), picking cells at coordinates (r, c1) and (r + 1, c2) will subtract abs(c1 - c2) from your score.Return the maximum number of points you can achieve.abs(x) is defined as:x for x = 0.-x for x  0.

The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color.The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.For example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.You want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.For example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.[4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.Return the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are not painted).

In this country, there is a road connecting every pair of cities.There are m friends numbered from 0 to m - 1 who are traveling through the country. Each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. Each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. The path may contain a city more than once, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.Given an integer n and a 2D integer array paths where paths[i] is an integer array representing the path of the ith friend, return the length of the longest common subpath that is shared by every friends path, or 0 if there is no common subpath at all.A subpath of a path is a contiguous sequence of cities within that path.
73	Count Good Numbers A digit string is good if the digits (0-indexed) at even indices are even and the digits at odd indices are prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).For example, 2582 is good because the digits (2 and 8) at even positions are even and the digits (5 and 2) at odd positions are prime. However, 3245 is not good because 3 is at an even index but is not even.Given an integer n, return the total number of good digit strings of length n.

The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in kilometers per minute.You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. However, the weapon takes one minute to charge.The weapon is fully charged at the very start.You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.

The roads are represented as a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei] denotes a road between cities xi and yi that takes timei minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a 0-indexed integer array passingFees of length n where passingFees[j] is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city j.In the beginning, you are at city 0 and want to reach city n - 1 in maxTime minutes or less. The cost of your journey is the summation of passing fees for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (including the source and destination cities).Given maxTime, edges, and passingFees, return the minimum cost to complete your journey, or -1 if you cannot complete it within maxTime minutes.

On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one ? in num:<ol>Choose an index i where num[i] == ?.Replace num[i] with any digit between 0 and 9.</ol>The game ends when there are no more ? characters in num.For Bobto win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Aliceto win, the sums must not be equal.For example, if the game ended with num = 243801, then Bobwins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = 243803, then Alicewins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice will win and false if Bob will win.

85	Minimum Absolute Difference Queries The minimum absolute difference of an array a is defined as the minimum value of |a[i] - a[j]|, where 0 = i  j  a.length and a[i] != a[j]. If all elements of a are the same, the minimum absolute difference is -1.For example, the minimum absolute difference of the array [5,<u>2</u>,<u>3</u>,7,2] is |2 - 3| = 1. Note that it is not 0 because a[i] and a[j] must be different.You are given an integer array nums and the array queries where queries[i] = [li, ri]. For each query i, compute the minimum absolute difference of the subarray nums[li...ri] containing the elements of nums between the 0-based indices li and ri (inclusive).Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.The value of |x| is defined as:x if x = 0.-x if x  0.
86	The Number of Full Rounds You Have Played A new online video game has been released, and in this video game, there are 15-minute rounds scheduled every quarter-hour period. This means that at HH:00, HH:15, HH:30 and HH:45, a new round starts, where HH represents an integer number from 00 to 23. A 24-hour clock is used, so the earliest time in the day is 00:00 and the latest is 23:59.Given two strings startTime and finishTime in the format HH:MM representing the exact time you started and finished playing the game, respectively, calculate the number of full rounds that you played during your game session.For example, if startTime = 05:20 and finishTime = 05:59 this means you played only one full round from 05:30 to 05:45. You did not play the full round from 05:15 to 05:30 because you started after the round began, and you did not play the full round from 05:45 to 06:00 because you stopped before the round ended.If finishTime is earlier than startTime, this means you have played overnight (from startTime to the midnight and from midnight to finishTime).Return the number of full rounds that you have played if you had started playing at startTime and finished at finishTime.
87	Largest Odd Number in String You are given a string num, representing a large integer. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of num, or an empty string  if no odd integer exists.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
89	The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7Player 1 competes against player 7.Player 2 competes against player 6.Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and thelatest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.

More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 = i  k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.Return the maximum k you can choose such that p is still a subsequence of s after the removals.A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
91	Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].Return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

93	Design Movie Rental System You have a movie renting company consisting of n shops. You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies.Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei] indicates that there is a copy of movie moviei at shop shopi with a rental price of pricei. Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei.The system should support the following functions:Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the jth cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj. The movies in res should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopj should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the smaller moviej should appear first. If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented, then an empty list should be returned.Implement the MovieRentingSystem class:MovieRentingSystem(int n, int[][] entries) Initializes the MovieRentingSystem object with n shops and the movies in entries.ListInteger search(int movie) Returns a list of shops that have an unrented copy of the given movie as described above.void rent(int shop, int movie) Rents the given movie from the given shop.void drop(int shop, int movie) Drops off a previously rented movie at the given shop.ListListInteger report() Returns a list of cheapest rented movies as described above.Note: The test cases will be generated such that rent will only be called if the shop has an unrented copy of the movie, and drop will only be called if the shop had previously rented out the movie.
94	Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.For example, the alternating sum of [4,2,5,3] is (4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4.Given an array nums, return the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of nums (after reindexing the elements of the subsequence).A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements relative order. For example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,<u>2</u>,3,<u>7</u>,2,1,<u>4</u>] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.
95	Remove All Occurrences of a Substring Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.Return s after removing all occurrences of part.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

97	Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 <i>if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. </i>Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
98	Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is 0 it becomes 1 and vice-versa.Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.For example, the strings 010 and 1010 are alternating, while the string 0100 is not.
99	Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal Given an integer array nums, your goal is to make all elements in nums equal. To complete one operation, follow these steps:<ol>Find the largest value in nums. Let its index be i (0-indexed) and its value be largest. If there are multiple elements with the largest value, pick the smallest i.Find the next largest value in nums strictly smaller than largest. Let its value be nextLargest.Reduce nums[i] to nextLargest.</ol>Return the number of operations to make all elements in nums equal.
100	Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation Given two n x n binary matrices mat and target, return true if it is possible to make mat equal to target by rotating mat in 90-degree increments, or false otherwise.
101	Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time You are given an integer hoursBefore, the number of hours you have to travel to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly2hours, you do not need to wait.However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.
102	Process Tasks Using Servers You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays servers and tasks of lengths n​​​​​​ and m​​​​​​ respectively. servers[i] is the weight of the i​​​​​​th​​​​ server, and tasks[j] is the time needed to process the j​​​​​​th​​​​ task in seconds.Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.A server that is assigned task j at second t will be free again at second t + tasks[j].Build an array ans​​​​ of length m, where ans[j] is the index of the server the j​​​​​​th task will be assigned to.Return the array ans​​​​.
103	Maximum Value after Insertion You are given a very large integer n, represented as a string,​​​​​​ and an integer digit x. The digits in n and the digit x are in the inclusive range [1, 9], and n may represent a negative number.You want to maximize ns numerical value by inserting x anywhere in the decimal representation of n​​​​​​. You cannot insert x to the left of the negative sign.For example, if n = 73 and x = 6, it would be best to insert it between 7 and 3, making n = 763.If n = -55 and x = 2, it would be best to insert it before the first 5, making n = -255.Return a string representing the maximum value of n​​​​​​ after the insertion.
104	Check if Word Equals Summation of Two Words The letter value of a letter is its position in the alphabet starting from 0 (i.e. a - 0, b - 1, c - 2, etc.).The numerical value of some string of lowercase English letters s is the concatenation of the letter values of each letter in s, which is then converted into an integer.For example, if s = acb, we concatenate each letters letter value, resulting in 021. After converting it, we get 21.You are given three strings firstWord, secondWord, and targetWord, each consisting of lowercase English letters a through j inclusive.Return true if the summation of the numerical values of firstWord and secondWord equals the numerical value of targetWord, or false otherwise.
105	Minimum Cost to Change the Final Value of Expression You are given a valid boolean expression as a string expression consisting of the characters 1,0,&amp; (bitwise AND operator),| (bitwise OR operator),(, and ).For example, ()1|1 and (1)&amp;() are not valid while 1, (((1))|(0)), and 1|(0&amp;(1)) are valid expressions.Return the minimum cost to change the final value of the expression.For example, if expression = 1|1|(0&amp;0)&amp;1, its value is 1|1|(0&amp;0)&amp;1 = 1|1|0&amp;1 = 1|0&amp;1 = 1&amp;1 = 1. We want to apply operations so that the new expression evaluates to 0.The cost of changing the final value of an expression is the number of operations performed on the expression. The types of operations are described as follows:Turn a 1 into a 0.Turn a 0 into a 1.Turn a &amp; into a |.Turn a | into a &amp;.Note: &amp; does not take precedence over | in the order of calculation. Evaluate parentheses first, then in left-to-right order.

When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk.
107	Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered You are given a 2D integer array ranges and two integers left and right. Each ranges[i] = [starti, endi] represents an inclusive interval between starti and endi.Return true if each integer in the inclusive range [left, right] is covered by at least one interval in ranges.

To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.For example, if the 1st train ride takes 1.5 hours, you must wait for an additional 0.5 hours before you can depart on the 2nd train ride at the 2 hour mark.Return the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or -1 if it is impossible to be on time.Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed 107 and hour will have at most two digits after the decimal point.
111	Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros Given a binary string s, return true if the longest contiguous segment of 1s is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of 0s in s, or return false otherwise.For example, in s = <u>11</u>01<u>000</u>10 the longest continuous segment of 1s has length 2, and the longest continuous segment of 0s has length 3.Note that if there are no 0s, then the longest continuous segment of 0s is considered to have a length 0. The same applies if there is no 1s.

You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly ksticks are visible from the left. A stickis visible from the left if there are no longersticks to the left of it.For example, if the sticks are arranged [<u>1</u>,<u>3</u>,2,<u>5</u>,4], then the sticks with lengths 1, 3, and 5 are visible from the left.Given n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

114	Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating Given a binary string s, return the minimum number of character swaps to make it alternating, or -1 if it is impossible.The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the strings 010 and 1010 are alternating, while the string 0100 is not.Any two characters may be swapped, even if they arenot adjacent.
115	Sum of All Subset XOR Totals The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.

The values are in descending order and adjacent values differ by 1, so this way is valid.Another example, the string s = 001 can be split into [0, 01], [00, 1], or [0, 0, 1]. However all the ways are invalid because they have numerical values [0,1], [0,1], and [0,0,1] respectively, all of which are not in descending order.Return true if it is possible to split s​​​​​​ as described above, or false otherwise.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

For each element from left to right in instructions, insert it into nums. The cost of each insertion is the minimum of the following:The number of elements currently in nums that are strictly less than instructions[i].The number of elements currently in nums that are strictly greater than instructions[i].For example, if inserting element 3 into nums = [1,2,3,5], the cost of insertion is min(2, 1) (elements 1 and 2 are less than 3, element 5 is greater than 3) and nums will become [1,2,3,3,5].Return the total cost to insert all elements from instructions into nums. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7
267	Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants orders balls of any color.The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored balls value is the number of balls of that coloryou currently have in your inventory. For example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).You are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the number of balls of the ith color that you initially own. You are also given an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants.

Lets define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.Successor(x, curOrder):    if x has no children or all of xs children are in curOrder:        if x is the king return null        else return Successor(xs parent, curOrder)    else return xs oldest child whos not in curOrderFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alices son Jack.<ol>In the beginning, curOrder will be [king].Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [king, Alice].Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [king, Alice, Jack].Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [king, Alice, Jack, Bob].Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [king, Alice, Jack, Bob].</ol>Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.Implement the ThroneInheritance class:ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.void death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesnt affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.string[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.
305	Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit.

570	The Dining Philosophers Five silent philosopherssit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks.

After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve;<i>i.e.</i>, each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.<p style="text-align: center">The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org<The philosophers ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the functionvoid wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:philosopheris the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.pickLeftForkandpickRightForkare functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.eatis a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has pickedboth forks.putLeftForkandputRightForkare functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).Five threads, each representing a philosopher, willsimultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.
571	Design Skiplist Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:<small>Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).See more about Skiplist: <Implement the Skiplist class:Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at(n-1, n-2)and(n-1, n-1).In one move the snake can:Move one cell to the rightif there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.Move down one cellif there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.Rotate clockwise if its in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty.

671	Brace Expansion II Under the grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words. Lets use R(expr) to denote the set of words the expression represents.Grammar can best be understood through simple examples:Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.R(a) = {a}R(w) = {w}When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.R({a,b,c}) = {a,b,c}R({{a,b},{b,c}}) = {a,b,c} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.R({a,b}{c,d}) = {ac,ad,bc,bd}R(a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}) = {abdfg, abdfh, abefg, abefh, acdfg, acdfh, acefg, acefh}Formally, the three rules for our grammar:For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.For expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k = 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) &cup; R(e2) &cup; ...For expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) &times; R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and &times; denotes the cartesian product.Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.

673	Building H2O There are two kinds of threads: oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules.There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.In other words:If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

In one move, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.In particular, if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).Return an integer array answer of length 2 where:answer[0] is the minimum number of moves you can play, andanswer[1] is the maximum number of moves you can play.

Formally, lets say the stones are currently at positions x, y, and z with x  y  z. You pick up the stone at either position x or position z, and move that stone to an integer position k, with x  k  z and k != y.The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).Return an integer array answer of length 2 where:answer[0] is the minimum number of moves you can play, andanswer[1] is the maximum number of moves you can play.

The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i  j) in the following way:During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] = arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] = arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).Return the number of good starting indices.

The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
773	Fibonacci Number The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n  1.Given n, calculate F(n).
774	Equal Rational Numbers Given two strings s and t, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return true if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.A rational number can be represented using up to three parts: IntegerPart, NonRepeatingPart, and a RepeatingPart. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:IntegerPartFor example, 12, 0, and 123.IntegerPart.NonRepeatingPartFor example, 0.5, 1., 2.12, and 123.0001.IntegerPart.NonRepeatingPart(RepeatingPart)For example, 0.1(6), 1.(9), 123.00(1212).The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets. For example:1/6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66).

You are also given a sequence of n values voyage, which is the desired pre-order traversal< of the binary tree.Any node in the binary tree can be flipped by swapping its left and right subtrees. For example, flipping node 1 will have the following effect:Flip the smallest number of nodes so that the pre-order traversal of the tree matches voyage.Return a list of the values of all flipped nodes.

In your answer, each value should occur at most once.
777	Pancake Sorting Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.In one pancake flip we do the following steps:Choose an integer k where 1 = k = arr.length.Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [<u>1</u>,<u>2</u>,<u>3</u>,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.

For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3.When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.There are no parentheses placed anywhere.We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-). For example, x - x is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but -x + x is not because it uses negation.We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given target. Return the least number of operators used.
783	Minimum Area Rectangle II You are given an array of points in the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi].Return the minimum area of any rectangle formed from these points, with sides not necessarily parallel to the X and Y axes.

If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.
791	Delete Columns to Make Sorted II You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.For example, if we have strs = [abcdef,uvwxyz] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is [bef, vyz].Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices answer such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in lexicographic order (i.e., strs[0] = strs[1] = strs[2] = ... = strs[n - 1]).

Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more . or +.For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.If you add periods . between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.For example, alice.z@leetcode.com and alicez@leetcode.com forward to the same email address.If you add a plus + in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.For example, m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.Given an array of strings emails where we send one email to each email[i], return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.

For example, [1,1,0] represents 6 in decimal, not 3. Also, leading zeros are allowed, so [0,1,1] and [1,1] represent the same value.
820	Flip String to Monotone Increasing A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0s (possibly none), followed by some number of 1s (also possibly none).You are given a binary string s.

This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.Suppose M(initial) is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops. We will remove exactly one node from initial.Return the node that, if removed, would minimize M(initial). If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize M(initial), return such a node with the smallest index.Note that if a node was removed from the initial list of infected nodes, it might still be infected later due to the malware spread.

You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:<ol>Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.</ol>Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

899	Car Fleet There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it, and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed.The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

All the given data in richer are logically correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is richer than y and y is richer than x at the same time).Return an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.
902	Rectangle Area II You are given a 2D array of axis-aligned rectangles. Each rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] denotes the ith rectangle where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.Calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once.Return the total area. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
903	Maximize Distance to Closest Person You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed).There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.Return that maximum distance to the closest person.
904	Shifting Letters You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an integer array shifts of the same length.Call the shift() of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that z becomes a).For example, shift(a) = b, shift(t) = u, and shift(z) = a.Now for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first i + 1 letters of s, x times.Return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.

907	Longest Mountain in Array You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:arr.length = 3There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0  i  arr.length - 1 such that:arr[0]  arr[1]  ...  arr[i - 1]  arr[i]arr[i]  arr[i + 1]  ...  arr[arr.length - 1]Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.
908	Backspace String Compare Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.
909	Guess the Word This is an interactive problem.You are given an array of unique strings wordlist where wordlist[i] is 6 letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as secret.You may call Master.guess(word) to guess a word. The guessed word should have type string and must be from the original list with 6 lowercase letters.This function returns an integer type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return -1 instead.For each test case, you have exactly 10 guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made 10 or fewer calls to Master.guess and at least one of these guesses was secret, then you pass the test case.
910	Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence You are given a string of digits num, such as 123456579. We can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list f of non-negative integers such that:0 = f[i]  231, (that is, each integer fits in a 32-bit signed integer type),f.length = 3, andf[i] + f[i + 1] == f[i + 2] for all 0 = i  f.length - 2.Note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from num, or return [] if it cannot be done.
911	Keys and Rooms There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.
912	Magic Squares In Grid A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.Given a row x colgridof integers, how many 3 x 3 magic square subgrids are there? (Each subgrid is contiguous).
913	Similar String Groups Two strings Xand Yare similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so thatit equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.For example, tarsand ratsare similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and rats and arts are similar, but star is not similar to tars, rats, or arts.Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {tars, rats, arts} and {star}. Notice that tars and arts are in the same group even though they are not similar. Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?
914	Push Dominoes There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.You are given a string dominoes representing the initial state where:dominoes[i] = L, if the ith domino has been pushed to the left,dominoes[i] = R, if the ith domino has been pushed to the right, anddominoes[i] = ., if the ith domino has not been pushed.Return a string representing the final state.
915	New 21 Game Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game 21.Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.
916	Rectangle Overlap An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.
917	Image Overlap You are given two images, img1 and img2, represented as binary, square matrices of size n x n. A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.We translate one image however we choose by sliding all the 1 bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation. Any 1 bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.Return the largest possible overlap.
918	Sum of Distances in Tree There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.You are given the integer n and the array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.Return an array answer of length n where answer[i] is the sum of the distances between the ith node in the tree and all other nodes.
919	Find And Replace in String You are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k.To complete the ith replacement operation:<ol>Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s.If it does not occur, do nothing.Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i].</ol>For example, if s = <u>ab</u>cd, indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = ab, and targets[i] = eee, then the result of this replacement will be <u>eee</u>cd.All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap.For example, a testcase with s = abc, indices = [0, 1], and sources = [ab,bc] will not be generated because the ab and bc replacements overlap.Return the resulting string after performing all replacement operations on s.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
920	Flipping an Image Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].
921	Design Circular Queue Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called Ring Buffer.One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.Implementation the MyCircularQueue class:MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language.
922	Design Circular Deque Design your implementation of the circular double-ended queue (deque).Implement the MyCircularDeque class:MyCircularDeque(int k) Initializes the deque with a maximum size of k.boolean insertFront() Adds an item at the front of Deque. Returns true if the operation is successful, or false otherwise.boolean insertLast() Adds an item at the rear of Deque. Returns true if the operation is successful, or false otherwise.boolean deleteFront() Deletes an item from the front of Deque. Returns true if the operation is successful, or false otherwise.boolean deleteLast() Deletes an item from the rear of Deque. Returns true if the operation is successful, or false otherwise.int getFront() Returns the front item from the Deque. Returns -1 if the deque is empty.int getRear() Returns the last item from Deque. Returns -1 if the deque is empty.boolean isEmpty() Returns true if the deque is empty, or false otherwise.boolean isFull() Returns true if the deque is full, or false otherwise.
923	Masking Personal Information You are given a personal information string s, representing either an email address or a phone number. Return the masked personal information using the below rules.<u>Email address:</u>An email address is:A name consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters, followed byThe @ symbol, followed byThe domain consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters with a dot . somewhere in the middle (not the first or last character).To mask an email:The uppercase letters in the name and domain must be converted to lowercase letters.The middle letters of the name (i.e., all but the first and last letters) must be replaced by 5 asterisks *****.<u>Phone number:</u>A phone number is formatted as follows:The phone number contains 10-13 digits.The last 10 digits make up the local number.The remaining 0-3 digits, in the beginning, make up the country code.Separation characters from the set {+, -, (, ),  } separate the above digits in some way.To mask a phone number:Remove all separation characters.The masked phone number should have the form:***-***-XXXX if the country code has 0 digits.+*-***-***-XXXX if the country code has 1 digit.+**-***-***-XXXX if the country code has 2 digits.+***-***-***-XXXX if the country code has 3 digits.XXXX is the last 4 digits of the local number.
924	Positions of Large Groups In a string sof lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.For example, a string like s = abbxxxxzyy has the groups a, bb, xxxx, z, andyy.A group is identified by an interval[start, end], wherestartandenddenote the start and endindices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example,xxxxhas the interval[3,6].A group is consideredlargeif it has 3 or more characters.Returnthe intervals of every large group sorted inincreasing order by start index.
925	Consecutive Numbers Sum Given an integer n, return the number of ways you can write n as the sum of consecutive positive integers.
926	Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String Lets define a function countUniqueChars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s.For example if s = LEETCODE then L, T, C, O, D are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.Given a string s, return the sum of countUniqueChars(t) where t is a substring of s.Notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.
927	Making A Large Island You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.
928	Most Profit Assigning Work You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, andworker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
929	Friends Of Appropriate Ages There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.A Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:age[y] = 0.5 * age[x] + 7age[y]  age[x]age[y]  100 &amp;&amp; age[x]  100Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.Return the total number of friend requests made.
930	Goat Latin You are given a string sentence that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.We would like to convert the sentence to Goat Latin (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append ma to the end of the word.For example, the word apple becomes applema.If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add ma.For example, the word goat becomes oatgma.Add one letter a to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.For example, the first word gets a added to the end, the second word gets aa added to the end, and so on.Return the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin.
931	Binary Trees With Factors Given an array of unique integers, arr, where each integer arr[i] is strictly greater than 1.We make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf nodes value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.Return the number of binary trees we can make. The answer may be too large so return the answer modulo 109 + 7.
932	Card Flipping Game You are given n cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different). You can flip any number of cards (possibly zero).After choosing the front and the back of each card, you will pick each card, and if the integer printed on the back of this card is not printed on the front of any other card, then this integer is good.You are given two integer array fronts and backs where fronts[i] and backs[i] are the integers printer on the front and the back of the ith card respectively.Return the smallest good and integer after flipping the cards. If there are no good integers, return 0.Note that a flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.
933	Shortest Distance to a Character Given a string s and a character c that occurs in s, return an array of integers answer where answer.length == s.length and answer[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurrence of character c in s.The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j), where abs is the absolute value function.
934	Short Encoding of Words A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:words.length == indices.lengthThe reference string s ends with the # character.For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next # character is equal to words[i].Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words.
935	Design Linked List Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.Implement the MyLinkedList class:MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.void deleteAtIndex(int index) Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.
936	Most Common Word Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.
937	Race Car Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse):When you get an instruction A, your car does the following:position += speedspeed *= 2When you get an instruction R, your car does the following:If your speed is positive then speed = -1otherwise speed = 1Your position stays the same.For example, after commands AAR, your car goes to positions 0 -- 1 -- 3 -- 3, and your speed goes to 1 -- 2 -- 4 -- -1.Given a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.
938	Linked List Components You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.Return the number of connected components in nums where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.
939	Ambiguous Coordinates We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like (1, 3) or (2, 0.5). Then, we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces and ended up with the string s.For example, (1, 3) becomes s = (13) and (2, 0.5) becomes s = (205).Return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like 00, 0.0, 0.00, 1.0, 001, 00.01, or any other number that can be represented with fewer digits. Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occurring before it, so we never started with numbers like .1.The final answer list can be returned in any order. All coordinates in the final answer have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)
940	Bus Routes You are given an array routes representing bus routes where routes[i] is a bus route that the ith bus repeats forever.For example, if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the 0th bus travels in the sequence 1 - 5 - 7 - 1 - 5 - 7 - 1 - ... forever.You will start at the bus stop source (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop target. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.Return the least number of buses you must take to travel from source to target. Return -1 if it is not possible.
941	Binary Tree Pruning Given the root of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.A subtree of a node node is node plus every node that is a descendant of node.
942	Largest Sum of Averages You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can partition the array into at most k non-empty adjacent subarrays. The score of a partition is the sum of the averages of each subarray.Note that the partition must use every integer in nums, and that the score is not necessarily an integer.Return the maximum score you can achieve of all the possible partitions. Answers within 10-6 of the actual answer will be accepted.
943	Largest Triangle Area Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
944	Subdomain Visit Count A website domain discuss.leetcode.com consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have com, at the next level, we have leetcode.comand at the lowest level, discuss.leetcode.com. When we visit a domain like discuss.leetcode.com, we will also visit the parent domains leetcode.com and com implicitly.A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats rep d1.d2.d3 or rep d1.d2 where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.For example, 9001 discuss.leetcode.com is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.
945	Chalkboard XOR Game You are given an array of integers nums represents the numbers written on a chalkboard.Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses. The bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
946	Expressive Words Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For example:hello - heeellooohi - hiiiiIn these strings like heeellooo, we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: h, eee, ll, ooo.You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.For example, starting with hello, we could do an extension on the group o to get hellooo, but we cannot get helloo since the group oo has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like ll - lllll to get helllllooo. If s = helllllooo, then the query word hello would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = hello - hellooo - helllllooo = s.Return the number of query strings that are stretchy.
947	Soup Servings There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially, we have n ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:<ol>Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B,Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B,Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B, andServe 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B.</ol>When we serve some soup, we give it to someone, and we no longer have it. Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with an equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as possible. We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.Note that we do not have an operation where all 100 mls of soup B are used first.Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
948	Max Increase to Keep City Skyline There is a city composed of n x n blocks, where each block contains a single building shaped like a vertical square prism. You are given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix grid where grid[r][c] represents the height of the building located in the block at row r and column c.A citys skyline is the the outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the city from a distance. The skyline from each cardinal direction north, east, south, and west may be different.We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings by any amount (the amount can be different per building). The height of a 0-height building can also be increased. However, increasing the height of a building should not affect the citys skyline from any cardinal direction.Return the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased by without changing the citys skyline from any cardinal direction.
949	Number of Lines To Write String You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an array widths denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, widths[0] is the width of a, widths[1] is the width of b, and so on.You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.Return an array result of length 2 where:result[0] is the total number of lines.result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.

A brick is stable if:It is directly connected to the top of the grid, orAt least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.You are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location(if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).Return an array result, where each result[i] is the number of bricks that will fall after the ith erasure is applied.Note that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.

The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.
954	Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing You are given two integer arrays of the same length nums1 and nums2. In one operation, you are allowed to swap nums1[i] with nums2[i].For example, if nums1 = [1,2,3,<u>8</u>], and nums2 = [5,6,7,<u>4</u>], you can swap the element at i = 3 to obtain nums1 = [1,2,3,4] and nums2 = [5,6,7,8].Return the minimum number of needed operations to make nums1 and nums2 strictly increasing. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.An array arr is strictly increasing if and only if arr[0]  arr[1]  arr[2]  ...  arr[arr.length - 1].
955	Design HashMap Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.Implement the MyHashMap class:MyHashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap.

If key does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.
957	Champagne Tower We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row. Each glass holds one cupof champagne.Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top. When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it. When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on. (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full. After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now. After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.<img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/09/tower.png" style="height: 241px; width: 350px;" />Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)
958	Smallest Rotation with Highest Score You are given an array nums. You can rotate it by a non-negative integer k so that the array becomes [nums[k], nums[k + 1], ... nums[nums.length - 1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]. Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1  0 [no points], 3  1 [no points], 0 = 2 [one point], 2 = 3 [one point], 4 = 4 [one point].Return the rotation index k that corresponds to the highest score we can achieve if we rotated nums by it.

All actions happen simultaneously.You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.Return true if it is possible to escape regardless of how the ghosts move, otherwise return false.

Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like 2x or -x.Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.For example, expression = 1 + 2 * 3 has an answer of [7].The format of the output is as follows:For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.For example, we would never write a term like b*a*c, only a*b*c.Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.For example, a*a*b*c has degree 4.The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.An example of a well-formatted answer is [-2*a*a*a, 3*a*a*b, 3*b*b, 4*a, 5*c, -6].Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.For example, an expression of 0 has an output of [].

1004	Set Intersection Size At Least Two An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a  b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has a size of at least two.
1005	Pyramid Transition Matrix You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top.To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are givenas a list ofthree-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.For example, ABC represents a triangular pattern with a C block stacked on top of an A (left) and B (right) block. Note that this is different from BAC where B is on the left bottom and A is on the right bottom.You start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid.Given bottom and allowed, return true if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that every triangular pattern in the pyramid is in allowed, or false otherwise.
1006	Reach a Number You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target.You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:On each move, you can either go left or right.During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.
1007	Cracking the Safe There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.For example, the correct password is 345 and you enter in 012345:After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is 0, which is incorrect.After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is 01, which is incorrect.After typing 2, the most recent 3 digits is 012, which is incorrect.After typing 3, the most recent 3 digits is 123, which is incorrect.After typing 4, the most recent 3 digits is 234, which is incorrect.After typing 5, the most recent 3 digits is 345, which is correct and the safe unlocks.Return any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it.
1008	Open the Lock You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn 9 to be 0, or 0 to be 9. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.The lock initially starts at 0000, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.
1009	Contain Virus A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.The world is modeled as an m x n binary grid isInfected, where isInfected[i][j] == 0 represents uninfected cells, and isInfected[i][j] == 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region (i.e., the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night). There will never be a tie.Return the number of walls used to quarantine all the infected regions. If the world will become fully infected, return the number of walls used.
1010	Shortest Completing Word Given a string licensePlate and an array of strings words, find the shortest completing word in words.A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in licensePlate. Ignore numbers and spaces in licensePlate, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in licensePlate, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.For example, if licensePlate = aBc 12c, then it contains letters a, b (ignoring case), and c twice. Possible completing words are abccdef, caaacab, and cbca.Return the shortest completing word in words. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in words.
1011	Largest Number At Least Twice of Others You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, or return -1 otherwise.
1012	Min Cost Climbing Stairs You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
1013	Prefix and Suffix Search Design a special dictionary with some words that searchs the words in it by a prefix and a suffix.Implement the WordFilter class:WordFilter(string[] words) Initializes the object with the words in the dictionary.f(string prefix, string suffix) Returns the index of the word in the dictionary, which has the prefix prefix and the suffix suffix. If there is more than one valid index, return the largest of them. If there is no such word in the dictionary, return -1.
1014	Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.Note that the letters wrap around.For example, if target == z and letters == [a, b], the answer is a.
1015	Network Delay Time You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
1016	To Lower Case Given a string s, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.
1017	Cherry Pickup You are given an n x n grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,1 means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below:Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (n - 1, n - 1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1).After reaching (n - 1, n - 1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells.When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell 0.If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1), then no cherries can be collected.
1018	Delete and Earn You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.
1019	Daily Temperatures Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
1020	Monotone Increasing Digits An integer has monotone increasing digits if and only if each pair of adjacent digits x and y satisfy x = y.Given an integer n, return the largest number that is less than or equal to n with monotone increasing digits.
1021	Parse Lisp Expression You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.(An integer could be positive or negative.)A let expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string let, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.An add expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string add, there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.A mult expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string mult, there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names add, let, and mult are protected and will never be used as variable names.Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.
1022	Asteroid Collision We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
1023	Flood Fill An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.You are also given three integers sr, sc, and newColor. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with newColor.Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
1024	My Calendar III A k-booking happens when k events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., there is some time that is common to all k events.)You are given some events [start, end), after each given event, return an integer k representing the maximum k-booking between all the previous events.Implement the MyCalendarThree class:MyCalendarThree() Initializes the object.int book(int start, int end) Returns an integer k representing the largest integer such that there exists a k-booking in the calendar.
1025	My Calendar II You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start = x  end.Implement the MyCalendarTwo class:MyCalendarTwo() Initializes the calendar object.boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
1026	Count Different Palindromic Subsequences Given a string s, return the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.Two sequences a1, a2, ... and b1, b2, ... are different if there is some i for which ai != bi.
1027	My Calendar I You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start = x  end.Implement the MyCalendar class:MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
1028	Self Dividing Numbers A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.A self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.Given two integers left and right, return a list of all the self-dividing numbers in the range [left, right].
1029	Number of Atoms Given a string formula representing a chemical formula,return the count of each atom.The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.One or more digits representing that elements count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow.For example, H2O and H2O2 are possible, but H1O2 is impossible.Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula.For example, H2O2He3Mg4 is also a formula.A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula.For example, (H2O2) and (H2O2)3 are formulas.Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.
1030	Split Linked List in Parts Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.Return an array of the k parts.
1031	Find Pivot Index Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the indexs right.If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
1032	Remove Comments Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of */ should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.The first effective comment takes precedence over others.For example, if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.For example, source = string s = /* Not a comment. */; will not be a test case.Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
1033	Accounts Merge Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
1034	Longest Word in Dictionary Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

1038	Range Module A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Design a data structure to track the ranges represented as half-open intervals and query about them.A half-open interval [left, right) denotes all the real numbers x where left = x  right.Implement the RangeModule class:RangeModule() Initializes the object of the data structure.void addRange(int left, int right) Adds the half-open interval [left, right), tracking every real number in that interval. Adding an interval that partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the interval [left, right) that are not already tracked.boolean queryRange(int left, int right) Returns true if every real number in the interval [left, right) is currently being tracked, and false otherwise.void removeRange(int left, int right) Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the half-open interval [left, right).

1040	Subarray Product Less Than K Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.
1041	Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings Given two strings s1 ands2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.
1043	Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if it is possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.
1052	Knight Probability in Chessboard On an n x n chessboard, a knight starts at the cell (row, column) and attempts to make exactly k moves. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, so the top-left cell is (0, 0), and the bottom-right cell is (n - 1, n - 1).A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard.Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.

The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
1057	Baseball Game You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds scores.At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

1059	24 Game You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators [+, -, *, /] and the parentheses ( and ) to get the value 24.You are restricted with the following rules:The division operator / represents real division, not integer division.For example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use - as a unary operator.For example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression -1 - 1 - 1 - 1 is not allowed.You cannot concatenate numbers togetherFor example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression 12 + 12 is not valid.Return true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.

1091	Decode Ways II A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:A - 1B - 2...Z - 26To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, 11106 can be mapped into:AAJF with the grouping (1 1 10 6)KJF with the grouping (11 10 6)Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because 06 cannot be mapped into F since 6 is different from 06.In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the * character, which can represent any digit from 1 to 9 (0 is excluded). For example, the encoded message 1* may represent any of the encoded messages 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19. Decoding 1* is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.Given a string s consisting of digits and * characters, return the number of ways to decode it.Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

1094	Exclusive Time of Functions On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.Function calls are stored in a call stack<: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string {function_id}:{start | end}:{timestamp}. For example, 0:start:3 means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and 1:end:2 means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.A functions exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.

Note that n = 1 and m = 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.The output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:directory_path/file_name.txt

1113	Tag Validator Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:<ol>The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : TAG_NAMETAG_CONTENT/TAG_NAME. Among them, TAG_NAME is the start tag, and /TAG_NAME is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched , unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.A  is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent . And when you find a  or /, all the subsequent characters until the next  should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).The cdata has the following format : ![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between ![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]].CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.</ol>

Otherwise, returns -1.void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item.

The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.The functions<code data-stringify-type="code">getand<code data-stringify-type="code">putmust each run in O(1) average time complexity.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place< with O(1) extra memory.Custom Judge:The judge will test your solution with the following code:int[] nums = [...]; // Input arrayint val = ...; // Value to removeint[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementationassert k == expectedNums.length;sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of numsfor (int i = 0; i  actualLength; i++) {    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];}If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
1548	Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place< such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of numsshould hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the firstkelements.Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place< with O(1) extra memory.Custom Judge:The judge will test your solution with the following code:int[] nums = [...]; // Input arrayint[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct lengthint k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementationassert k == expectedNums.length;for (int i = 0; i  k; i++) {    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];}If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
1549	Reverse Nodes in k-Group Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.You maynot alter the values in the lists nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

1560	Longest Common Prefix Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.If there is no common prefix, return an empty string .
1561	Roman to Integer Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:I, V, X, L, C, D and M.For example,2 is written as IIin Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written asXII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

1563	Container With Most Water Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.Notice that you may not slant the container.
1564	Regular Expression Matching Given an input string sand a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for . and * where:. Matches any single character.​​​​* Matches zero or more of the preceding element.The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
1565	Palindrome Number Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.
1566	String to Integer (atoi) Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++s atoi function).The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:<ol>Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is - or +. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. 123 - 123, 0032 - 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.Return the integer as the final result.</ol>Note:Only the space character   is considered a whitespace character.Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
1567	Reverse Integer Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
1568	ZigZag Conversion The string PAYPALISHIRING is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)And then read line by line: PAHNAPLSIIGYIRWrite the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:string convert(string s, int numRows);
